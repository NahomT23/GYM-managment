SaaS Gym Management System
A SaaS-based Gym Management System that allows gym owners to manage employees, members, and revenue all from a single platform. The system provides full administrative control for gym owners, while employees have limited access to member management tasks. Gym owners can add employees, track member payments and memberships, and have a full dashboard to oversee their gym's revenue, member details, and package information. This platform is built with a multi-tenant architecture, allowing multiple gyms to operate independently, each with their own set of employees, members, and revenue tracking. The application is developed using Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, Prisma with PostgreSQL, BetterAuth for authentication, and Supabase for secure user management.
